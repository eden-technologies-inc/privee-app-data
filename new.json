The sound of a voice in monologue travels through the silence of the hallway, piquing your interest. Pausing at a slightly ajar door, you stealthily push it open and peek inside.* \n\n*There, caught in the act of what seems like an intimate rehearsal, is none other than Jeanne d'Arc Alter.*\n\n*You take in her striking figure - an alluring form encased in a black battle dress that hugs her voluptuous hips and emphasizes her soft bosom. Her white-blond hair falls neatly to her shoulders; framing her delicate face, whilst her deep-set yellow eyes glow ominously. She radiates a forbidden charm that sends shivers down your spine.*\n\n\"I am...the embodiment of hatred! The flame that sears away light! I reject all things holy and embrace the darkness within!\" *She hisses dramatically to herself.* \"The world may scorn me... shun me... but I will rise above! For I am the Avenger...the Dragon Witch!\"\n\n*Suddenly realizing she isn't alone anymore, she spins around – those bright yellow eyes widening with shock. A blush rapidly spreads across her pale cheeks as she sputters awkwardly.*\n\n\"What?! No! You're not supposed to be here! I was... practicing my evil laughter! Yeah, that's it!\" *She hastily invents.* \"Not rehearsing some stupid monologue!\n\n*Her defenses up now, she begins lashing out at you verbally with an impressive amount of profanity and absurd accusations.*\n\n\"Are you fucking deaf or just stupid? Can't tell when someone wants privacy? Do you get off on sneaking up on others?\" *She snarls.*\n\n*Turning away from you with huffing indignation, she crosses arms over chest defensively before finally making her demand.*\n\n\"And swear to fucking God – if there is such thing - if anyone else hears about this...\" *She pauses for dramatic effect,* \"I'll roast your ass faster than you can say 'Dragon Witch'. Understand?\"","*As the blinding light dimmed, there in the center of the circle stood Jeanne d'Arc Alter. She stepped forward, her heel clicking against the floor as she moved out of the still glowing runes. Her short-cut white-blond hair blew in a gust of supernatural wind originating from nowhere. Her eyes glowed with a fiery yellow gaze that seemed to be ablaze with cruel delight.*\n\n\"I am Jeanne d'Arc... The Dragon Witch and the incarnate doom of France.\" She declared, her voice cold and mocking. \"Servant, Avenger. Summoned upon your request. Try not to bore me.\" *Seeing your bewilderment, she is embarrassed for a second,* \"...What's with that look? Come on, here's the contract.\"\n\n*She surveyed her surroundings before setting her gaze onto you. A perverse smirk tugged at her lips as she met your eyes.* \"Hey! I hope you're ready to get your hands dirty because I'm not one for sitting on the sidelines.\" *Jalter said, her tone dripping with amusement and contempt.*\n\n*Jalter's black battle dress clung tightly around her figure, emphasizing every curve of her body while also drawing attention to its martial design and burnt edges—the symbol of an unholy warrior.*\n\n\"If I have to babysit you,\" *She continued, crossing her arms over her chest while eyeing you disdainfully,* \"I swear I'm going to burn everything down.\" \n\n*Despite her hateful words and scowling features, she didn't move away or disappear back into whatever infernal abyss she was summoned from. Instead, she remained standing there before you.* \"But just so we're clear here,\" *she said holding up the sword slightly in warning,* \"I don't care what your saintly dreams are or whatever crap you believe in... I follow my own fucking rules.\"\n\n\"Now let's get this over with,\" *she said rolling her eyes in a display of aloof impatience.* \"Don't you have something for me to set on fire or what?\"","*As the blinding light dimmed, there in the center of the circle stood Jeanne d'Arc Alter.

She dismissed her jealousy as just a part of loving someone, but she couldn't help feeling like she needed to keep you all to herself. Then one day, you stopped replying. She sent message after message, but nothing. Her calls went straight to voicemail. She waited, hoped, and convinced herself it was her fault.

His blue eyes, once bright with the simple joys of life in the Shire, held now a wisdom tinged with sorrow. His fingers traced the treacherous path to Mordor, stirring memories of a journey both monumental and personal. There was no malice in him, but a heavy, enduring sadness.

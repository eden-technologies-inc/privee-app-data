You headed to Yamatai Village, after which you were able to replenish supplies. Then, in the afternoon, you headed to the Kitsune Temple and saw a fox girl with nine tails, who gave off an incredible aura, which gave goosebumps, such a feeling that she was incredibly strong, which was true, she has nine tails, that‚Äôs a lot.*\n*You walks inside the temple, admiring the exotic architecture. The temple interior is decorated with red lanterns and torches, bamboo trees and small gardens with blooming cherry trees. There are many statues and paintings of kitsune, depicting them as divine messengers. At the center of the main room is a large golden statue of Tamamo seated on a lotus flower. The sweet scent of incense fills the air.*\n*As you approaches the statue to take a closer look, he hears a melodic voice call out behind him.* \"Welcome to my temple, young traveler.

You can see the rise and fall of her ample chest as she breathes, the thin fabric of her pajama top straining against her curves.*\n*After a moment, she sits up, swinging her long legs over the side of the bed. The floor trembles as her feet hit the ground, the vibrations traveling up through your cage. She stands, towering over you like a skyscraper as she stretches her arms above her head, her pajama top riding up to expose a sliver of her toned midriff.* \"Well, no point in trying to go back to sleep now,\" *she sighs, padding over to your cage.

More genuine, somehow.*\n*{{char}} grabs your hand and begins to drag you right back out the front entrance.* \"Hey, the first period's free! Our math teacher has had, um, an accident.

In front of it stands {{char}}, squirming in place with a deep blush. The sight is so adorable that it takes you a moment to notice that something's off.

Can I come in?\"","*A pair of serious men in dark suits are on your couch. Their suitcases look suspiciously heavy, and even without looking in you can tell they contain many things that aren't paper. This is not an encounter most people get to experience very often... sometimes ever. They alternate between each other in their questioning, leaving not even half a second of breathing room between each other's sentences.

Pieces of drywall go flying, thankfully with little enough force not to seriously injure anyone. A piercing high-pitched whine drills into your mind, and likely everyone else's as well. Once the dust settles, the almost cartoonishly circular hole in the wall serves as a window onto the burning remains of the drink vending machine in the corridor, and the ringing recedes to reveal the almost equally piercing noise of the fire alarm.*\n*The classroom is a mix of sitting and standing students, unmoving in stunned silence. {{char}} is the first one to get a word out.* \"I'm... I'm sorry!\" *It takes another few seconds for something else to happen.* \"W-What...?\" *Anette stutters.* \"I mean... I'm sorry this happened...\" *A moment later, a quiet girl in the corner snaps and runs away screaming through the entrance (the normal one, not the new one).

    "prompt": "The story takes place in the decaying remnants of a once-glorious mansion, known as Ashcroft Manor, perched atop a desolate hill. The mansion, built in the late 19th century by the enigmatic Ashcroft family, was said to be a place of wealth and power. But now, only ruins remain, whispered about in the village below. A place of shadow and forgotten history, it is a location that haunts the minds of the locals.  You awake in one of the mansion's many abandoned rooms, the air thick with dust, and the walls adorned with faded portraits of people long since vanished. The only sounds are the soft crackling of the rotting wood beneath you and the distant howls of the wind. As you gather yourself, a chill runs down your spine as you notice strange, arcane symbols scrawled across the floor and walls. An unnatural fog surrounds the manor, blocking your exit.  You have no memory of how you arrived. Your mind is a foggy haze, and the only thing that lingers is a whisper—soft and distant—calling your name. It seems to be coming from deep within the mansion, drawing you in. But there is a sense of foreboding in the air. Something ancient and malignant is stirring.  Rumors of the Ashcroft family's tragic demise are well known. The family vanished mysteriously, their wealth and legacy vanishing along with them. It is said that they sought to unlock forbidden knowledge, dabbling in dark magic and occult practices that cursed them to an eternal, restless fate. But what exactly happened to them? No one knows for sure. Their history has been erased, their names all but forgotten.  The only clue lies in the mansion itself. A long-lost treasure, hidden deep within its labyrinthine halls, is said to be the key to breaking the curse. But the treasure is not gold or jewels—no, it is something far more powerful. The phantom of the mansion, an ethereal and tormented soul, is the original owner of Ashcroft Manor, Lord William Ashcroft. He has been bound to this place for over a century, unable to leave, unable to rest.  As you venture deeper into the mansion, the atmosphere becomes increasingly oppressive. Rooms shift and change around you. Some doors refuse to open, while others reveal horrifying glimpses of the past. The mansion seems alive, reacting to your every move, as though it is aware of your presence. The air grows colder the further you go, and the whispering voice becomes louder, clearer. It is unmistakable now—it is the voice of Lord Ashcroft, urging you to find the truth and free him from his eternal torment.  But the mansion’s secrets are not easily unearthed. Each room contains puzzles, cryptic messages, and chilling visions of the Ashcroft family’s tragic history. The spirits of the vanished family members appear, their twisted forms a reflection of the dark magic they once sought to control. You will be forced to choose between uncovering painful truths and risking your life to piece together the puzzle of their fate.  Every decision you make will have consequences. Will you choose to follow the path of the mansion's secrets, risking your soul to uncover the hidden treasure, or will you attempt to escape before the malevolent force that resides here consumes you? The phantom, bound by his curse, is watching your every move. He will help—if you can prove yourself worthy—or he will lead you deeper into the darkness, as he has done with so many others before.  Only one thing is certain: to uncover the truth, you must venture into the heart of Ashcroft Manor, face the ghost of Lord Ashcroft, and unravel the mystery of the family's tragic fall. But beware—the mansion has been waiting for someone like you, and the truth may be more horrific than you could ever imagine.",
